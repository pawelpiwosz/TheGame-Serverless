# :boom: The Game of Serverless

2025 edition

## :circus_tent: The Arena

Our Arena for this game is the World of Serverless. All solutions have to use serverless resources and serverless only. We also have to use AWS platform only.

There is only (again, I repeat this word very often :smile:) one way to not use serverless. When there is no choice and you see that you really need specific solution.

## :trophy: The goal

I publish some requirements for solution which is later discussed by group of Experts and everyon else who is interested in participation on LinkedIn. The Team has to find solution(s) to given problem to enable next steps. I act as a Game Master, my goal is different. I "win" when the Team is not able to find a solution for given requirements in Serverless world.

## :question: The Quest

This is the 2025 starting message published on LinkedIn

>The Serverless Game â€“ AWS re:Invent Companion App  
Welcome to The Game, where you'll architect a serverless application to elevate the AWS re:Invent experience for attendees, speakers, communities, and organizers. Each week, you'll tackle two business requirements paired with a quality attribute (-ility), progressively building a more complex, scalable, and robust system.  
This challenge is designed for all skill levels, allowing everyone from juniors to seasoned architects to participate and grow together.  

We played a Serverless game two years ago and I believe it was interesting and enjoyable experience for everyone. So, let's play it again!  

Important is, that I want to keep the game simple. What is revealed, is in scope. To give you a picture - if I didn't ask for black button, you are free to have any kind of button you want. If I didn't say that I want synchronous communication - the solution is up to you.  

My goal is to navigate you to hit the rocks. Think of me like about the Game Master (from RPG games).

I really wish to see this story growing :)

So, let's get started!

Please remember, we have to stay with Serverless solutions only!

## :moneybag: The application

Re:Invent. We all know it. Many of us were there. Of course, there are applications for re:Invent, but it doesn't matter. We want to build better one. The best one.

## :scroll: Rules

* Main rules
  * Everyone is welcome!
  * There is no bad solution! There are good or better ones :smile:
  * This is a game for fun, not an exam!  
  * Discuss, discuss discuss! I want you to make this place alive!  
* Game rules
  * Every week some of the requirements will be revealed by me in separate thread
  * We use only AWS serverless sevices!
  * What is revealed, is in scope. To give you a picture - if I didn't ask for black button, you are free to have any kind of button you want. If I didn't say that I want synchronous communication - the solution is up to you.  
  * Go as deep as you can. No, you don't need to provide the code :smile: As much details about solution you can give, the better and the more valuable our game will be.  
  * If you can, describe the functionalities of Lambda functions (for example what is needed to be run in handler, what should be in the init phase, etc), each step of Step functions, schemas and indexes in databases, and so on.

## :triangular_ruler: Architecture diagrams

> Please have in mind that the diagrams available in weekly directories represent only the parts mentioned by their authors.

This means that the pictures there might be not completed, might be focused on a single part of the bigger picture only.

## :lock: Final architecture

I'd like to create the final architecture from this excercise after the end of the game.
