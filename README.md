# :boom: The Game of Serverless

Hello all :wave:! This repository is a documentation of the Game played by great people on LinkedIn.

We had one game 2 years ago (wow, time flies...). I really enjoyed that game, I wonder if this time this game can be even bigger :smile:

## :circus_tent: The Arena

Our Arena for this game is the World of Serverless. All solutions have to use serverless resources and serverless only. We also have to use AWS platform only.

You can use solutions different than Serverless only when there is no other option. Ad you have to motivate it.

## :trophy: The goal

I publish some requirements for solution which is later discussed by group of Experts, fans and adepts on LinkedIn. The Team has to find solution(s) to given problem to enable next steps. I act as a Game Master, my goal is different. I "win" when the Team is not able to find a solution for given requirements in Serverless world.

## :question: The Quest

Go to proper directory (like Game2025) and there you find the game and requirements! 

## :scroll: Rules

* Main rules
  * Everyone is welcome!
  * There is no bad solution! There are good or better ones :smile:
  * This is a game for fun, not an exam!  
  * Discuss, discuss discuss! I want you to make this place alive!  
* Game rules
  * Every week some of the requirements will be revealed by me in separate thread
  * We use only AWS serverless sevices!
  * What is revealed, is in scope. To give you a picture - if I didn't ask for black button, you are free to have any kind of button you want. If I didn't say that I want synchronous communication - the solution is up to you.  
  * Go as deep as you can. No, you don't need to provide the code :smile: As much details about solution you can give, the better and the more valuable our game will be.  
  * If you can, describe the functionalities of Lambda functions (for example what is needed to be run in handler, what should be in the init phase, etc), each step of Step functions, schemas and indexes in databases, and so on.
  * Please, be creative and supportive
  * Discussion is MORE than welcome!

## :triangular_ruler: Architecture diagrams

> Please have in mind that the diagrams available in weekly directories represent only the parts mentioned by their authors.

This means that the pictures there might be not completed, might be focused on a single part of the bigger picture only.

## :lock: Final architecture

I'd like to create the final architecture from this excercise after the end of the game.
