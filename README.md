# :boom: The Game of Serverless

Hello all :wave:! This repository is a documentation of the Game played by great people on LinkedIn.

We had one game 3 years ago (wow, time flies...). I really enjoyed that game, I wonder if this time this game can be even bigger :smile:

## :circus_tent: The Arena

Our Arena for this game is the World of Serverless. All solutions have to use serverless resources and serverless only. We also have to use AWS platform only.

You can use solutions different than Serverless only when there is no other option. Ad you have to motivate it.

## :trophy: The goal

I publish some requirements for solution which is later discussed by group of Experts, fans and adepts on LinkedIn. The Team has to find solution(s) to given problem to enable next steps. I act as a Game Master, my goal is different. I "win" when the Team is not able to find a solution for given requirements in Serverless world.

## :question: The Quest

This is the original message published on LinkedIn

I will publish it when time will come :smile:

## :moneybag: The application

This will come soon!

## :triangular_ruler: Architecture diagrams

This means that the pictures there might be not completed, might be focused on a single part of the bigger picture only.

I'd like to create the final architecture from this excercise after the end of the game.
