## Requirements

Our goal for this week is to discuss Serverless application for voting purposes. Imagine, we have to design the frontend and backend system for mobile voting application. We have a few requirements only:

1. Client has to be logged in to vote
2. Client can vote only once
3. Client receives a confirmation of the action (or info that something went wrong)

What components should we design? What services are in scope?
