Totally Agree with [Sam](SamWilliams.md).  
Only instead of API Gateway, I would like to use Appsync for better real time experience.

How would the user experience differ between Appsync and API Gateway for a single request?

Sorry for not making it clear, I mean apart from above mentioned requirements. If we want to show the percentage/count of vote at real time, we can use Appsync subscription.
